# How to Add a Publication

To add a publication, follow these steps:

1. Open the file `publication.js` under `content`.
2. Add an object like the following example:

```
    {
      title: "The role of library versions in Developer-ChatGPT conversations",
      venue: "MSR 2024 Mining Challenge, 2024",
      authors: "Rachna Raj, Diego Elias Costa",
      pdfPathHref: "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16340",
      githubLink: "",
      datasetLink: "",
      presentationLink: "",
      replicationPackageLink: "",
      videoLink: "",
      year: 2024,
      type: "Conferences",
      project:"dependency-management",
      citation: `@inproceedings{10.1145/3643991.3645075,
               author = {Raj, Rachna and Costa, Diego Elias},
               title = {The role of library versions in Developer-ChatGPT conversations},
               year = {2024},
               isbn = {9798400705878},
               publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
               address = {New York, NY, USA},
               url = {https://doi.org/10.1145/3643991.3645075},
               doi = {10.1145/3643991.3645075},
               booktitle = {Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Mining Software Repositories},
               pages = {172â€“176},
               numpages = {5},
               location = {Lisbon, Portugal},
               series = {MSR '24}
}`
    },
```
The values that `type` can have are `Conferences`, `Journals`, or `Thesis`.
The values that `project` can have are `dependency-management`, `performance-engineering`, `se4ai`, or empty.
A publication entry having a non-empty `project` value will be displayed under both the `/publications` and the `/<project-name>` pages, there's no need to add two entries in two separate places for a given publication.
If a given link does not exist, provide an empty string to its associated attribute. For example, if a given publication does not have a presentation link, the value corresponding to `presentationLink` is `""`
3. In case the publications' resources will be placed directly in the project's file system instead of placing its link (the `pdfPathHref` value for example), make sure to place the given file under `static/publications`
4. Save the `publication.js` file

# How to Add a Team Member

To add a team member to your project, follow these steps:

1. **Add the Team Member's Image to the static/img Folder:**
   Place the team member's image in the `static/img` folder.

   
2. **Create a Markdown File for the Team Member's Details:**
   Create a Markdown file (e.g., `TeamMemberDetails.md`) inside the `src/pages/teamInfo` folder for the team member's details. Please find the MD syntax documentation [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). You can cutomize your page as you see fit.


3. **Open the `TeamMember.js` File:**
   Open the `TeamMember.js` file located in the same folder.


4. **Add a New Object to the `members` Array:**
   Add a new object to the `members` array in `TeamMember.js` under `content` with the following fields:

```
   {
     name: 'Team Member Name',
     role: 'Team Member Role',
     imageUrl: 'Img/TeamMemberImage.jpg (can be left empty to display default photo)',
     twitterUrl: 'URL to Team Member Twitter profile',
     linkedinUrl: 'URL to Team Member LinkedIn profile',
     details: 'teamInfo/TeamMemberDetails.md'
   },
```

In order to write `TeamMemberDetails.md`, you can learn how to write in Mark Down. A good example to follow is `src/components/pages/teamInfo/realise-citizen.md` where you can see the script in that file and its corresponding webpage [here](https://realiselab.github.io/teaminfo/realise-citizen) so you can know how to structure components in webpages using Mark Down.


5. **Save All Changes:**
Save all changes.

6. **Verify the Addition:**
After completing these steps, the new team member should be added to the team list on the website with the specified details and image.

# How to add a partner
1. **(Optional) Add partner logo picture**
Add the logo image under `static/img`. Note that you can put an image link from the internet instead of having the image in the project file system. The image width:height ratio has to be 5:2 to fit in a presentable way. Also, make sure to have white background removed for esthetic purposes.

2. **Add partner details**
In `content/Partners.js`, add an object in the partners array following this example:
```
    {
      name: 'FRQ - Nature et technologies',
      collaboration_topics: 'performance engineering, dependency management, SE4AI',
      imagePath: 'Img/frqnt-logo.png',
      link: 'https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/nature-et-technologies/'
    },
```

3. **Save the changes**
