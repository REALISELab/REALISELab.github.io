# Courses

Professor Diego Elias Costa (co-)designs and (co-)delivers courses related to Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. 

## Engineering AI-Based Software Systems (SOEN 691)

This course is part of the [SE4AI Training Program](https://se4ai.org/), a collaborative initiative between four Canadian universities to train professionals in developing and maintaining AI-based software systems. The course covers essential engineering concepts for AI systems, including requirements, architecture, data handling, model management, deployment, and monitoring. Students complete a project using a real-world open source AI system.

## Generative Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering

This course explores the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in Software Engineering practice and research. It covers topics such as prompt engineering, fine-tuning large language models, and applying GenAI to areas like requirements, design, development, testing, and maintenance. The course also addresses challenges and ethical issues related to deploying GenAI systems. Students will complete a research project applying GenAI techniques to Software Engineering problems.
