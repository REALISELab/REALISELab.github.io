# Courses


Professor Diego Elias Costa (co-)designs and (co-)delivers courses related to Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence. The courses are:

- [**Engineering AI-Based Software Systems**](https://github.com/create-se4ai/engineering-ai-systems-course)
- [**Generative Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering**](https://github.com/REALISELab/GenAI4SE-course)
- **ML/AI Engineering end-to-end systems course**

## Engineering AI-Based Software Systems

This course is part of the SE4AI Training Program, a training program on the development, deployment and servicing of Artificial Intelligence-based Software Systems. It introduces key concepts about using GenAI in Software Engineering practice and research. The course will include sessions on the topics of Prompt Engineering and Fine-tuning Large Language Models for Software Engineering Research. Subsequently, the course will focus on applying GenAI in Software Engineering research, covering the topics of Software Requirements, Software Design, Software Development, Software Testing, and Software Repair and Maintenance. Finally, we will cover special topics in the course related to the challenges of designing, implementing, and deploying systems with GenAI components and the ethical and societal implications of Generative AI. A course project involving a research project applying GenAI techniques to Software Engineering problems will be required.

## Generative Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering

This course introduces key concepts related to the engineering of AI-based software systems. Topics include requirements and architectures of AI-based software systems, data validation and management, model selection, quality assurance, deployment and continuous delivery of AI-based software systems. Additionally, special topics on interpreting and monitoring models, and operations in large-scale AI-based system will be included. A course project involving a real-world open source AI-based software system will be required.
