## Anchi Li
I am a Computer Science student at Beijing University of Technology with a strong interest in human-computer interaction and software engineering. I aim to bridge the gap between powerful AI capabilities and practical, everyday development tasks.

As a Mitacs research intern, I focus on optimizing code generation for low-resource libraries using large language models under the supervision of Dr. Diego Costa.

### Education

- Bachelor Computer Science and Technology at Beijing University of Technology, China (September 2022 - Present)

### Awards
- Mitacs Globalink Research Internship Award (2025)
- National Third Prize, 7th CCF Open Source Innovation Competition (2024)
- University-level Academic Excellence Scholarship, Beijing University of Technology (2023, 2025)
- University-level Innovation and Entrepreneurship Award, Beijing University of Technology (2023)

### Professional Experience

- Research Assistant at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (June 2024 - August 2024)
- Research Intern at REALISE Lab (July 2025 - October 2025)



### Research Interests
My research spans the intersection of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and software engineering. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that enhance both learning and development experiencesâ€”from LLM-enhanced educational platforms and pedagogical question generation to code generation tools for software engineers. I am particularly interested in how large language models can be applied to real-world domains through prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and fine-tuning techniques.
