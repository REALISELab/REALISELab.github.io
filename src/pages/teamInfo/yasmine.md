    I am an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering attending McGill University. My studies have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of technology, from the basics of transistor communication to complexities of CPUs, machine languages, and artifical intelligence. However, I am particularly fascinated by the emerging applications and methodologies in Computer Science. Given the rapid growth of this field, I believe in the importance of continuously seeking improvements in software applications and exploring the various aspects of these tools.

    The REALISE Lab aligns with my interests, especially as I work on dependency management in AI software tools under the supervision of Dr. Diego Costa.
