![Profile Picture](../../../static/img/RRaj.jpeg)

I'm a PhD student in Software Engineering. Before returning to school, I spent around five years as a software developer at Infosys and IBM India Software Labs. I'm driven to create solutions that automate boring, repetitive tasks for software developers so they can focus on the fun stuff—building awesome software for everyone! Right now, I'm focusing on dependency management and working on developing a tool to support library developers.


### Why Research ?
> I'm passionate about research because it lets me explore and solve problems that will benefit software development processes. PhD allows me to question and reason things and as Albert Einstein once said, "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." I aim to stay in academia and contribute to Software Engineering by bridging the gap between research and real-world applications.

### Research Interests

I am passionate about working on the topic of Software Maintenance, particularly in supporting open-source library developers and maintainers, exploring and enhancing Software Bills of Materials, and handling breaking changes. My career goal is to conduct cutting-edge research in software engineering and artificial intelligence, supporting the AI applications development lifecycle (SE4AI). I aim to explore innovative methods to harness AI (applied AI) in software engineering (AI4SE) to create technically advanced applications. As I progress in my academic journey, I also aspire to engage in EDI (Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion) within Software Engineering research, contributing to a safer and more inclusive future. Though these goals are ambitious, they inspire me to aim high!
