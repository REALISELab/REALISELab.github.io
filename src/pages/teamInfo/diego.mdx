## Diego Elias Damasceno Costa

Hi, I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html) department of [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/)
Before, I worked as an Assistant Professor with the Computer Science department at [UQAM](https://www.uqam.ca) in Montréal, Canada. I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), Canada, working with Prof. [Emad Shihab](https://das.encs.concordia.ca/members/emad-shihab/). I received my PhD from Heidelberg University, Germany in the [Parallel and Distributed Systems Group](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/home/) of [Prof. Andrzejak](https://pvs.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/team/aa/). 


I am interested in Software Engineering Research. In a few words, I want to reduce the burden on software developers by tackling aspects related to **software maintenance** and **software performance**. 
I like to leverage historical project data (e.g., GitHub) through Data Mining methods and apply Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis techniques to understand the problems developers face and provide insights/solutions to alleviate the issues.
