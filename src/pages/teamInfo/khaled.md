## Khaled Chawa

Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m an undergraduate Computer Science student at Concordia University, currently entering my final year. Though Iâ€™ve done a bit of freelance web development in the past, my true interests have always leaned toward AI and intelligent systems.

At the REALISE Lab, Iâ€™m working on measuring the energy consumption of different hardware components (like CPU and GPU) during the inference phase of large language models, especially when theyâ€™re solving software engineering tasks. This internship is part of the NSERC USRA program.

I donâ€™t have any published work (yet), but Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time trying to build AI systems as side projects, most of which havenâ€™t worked out, but all of which taught me something new. My current interests lie broadly in artificial intelligence, and this project has also introduced me to the world of performance engineering.

### Education
- Bachelor of Computer Science at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) (Sept 2022 â€“ Present)

### Research Interests
Iâ€™ve been fascinated by intelligent systems for as long as I can remember, and that curiosity has grown into a broad interest in artificial intelligence. While most of my personal AI projects have been experimental (and often unfinished), theyâ€™ve helped shape my drive to better understand and build meaningful systems. During my internship at the REALISE Lab, Iâ€™ve had the chance to explore the intersection of AI and performance engineering, specifically by analyzing the energy consumption of hardware components like CPUs and GPUs during the inference phase of LLMs on software engineering tasks. This blend of AI and low-level performance metrics has given me a new appreciation for the hidden costs of intelligence.
