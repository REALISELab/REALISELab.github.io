# Autobiography of REALISE Citizen

Hello dear RELEASE citizen. Go grab a cup of coffee (you can take a coffee pod from Bilel's drawer) and settle in home sweet home (aka ER 10th room 1024) to have an hour of reflection to write your achievements.
The following content is used to showcase to you different tricks to make your page stand out (no competion though please). So make sure to look at the content in the actual website [here](https://realiselab.github.io/teamInfo/realise-citizen) and `src/css/pages/teamInfo/realise-citizen.md` in [this](https://github.com/REALISELab/REALISELab.github.io) Github repo.



## Sample title

You do a bold text like **this**, you do a hyperlink like [this](https://cdn.freebiesupply.com/logos/large/2x/concordia-university-1-logo-png-transparent.png).

This is how you get a picture from the public internet to put it in this page :
![Profile Picture](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsFlj9JEw-GVINWKmwdUDQyH5w5Xgz32J3lQ&s)



In case you want the image to be hosted on the website, you can put it under `src/static/img` and refer to it like this :
![Profile Picture](../../../static/img/concordia-logo.png)

You can even use HTML to embed sometihng like a picture like this :

<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQsFlj9JEw-GVINWKmwdUDQyH5w5Xgz32J3lQ&s" alt="Profile Picture" width="500" />

I hope that the coffee is done by now, please don't take another pod, you'll get a high caffeine doze (the pods have the highest level of caffeine).
