As the internship period comes to an end, we gathered to bid a fond farewell to our interns, Adam and Yasmine. Over the past few months, their contributions have been invaluable, and they have truly become part of our lab family. To celebrate their hard work and dedication, we shared a delicious cake and exchanged heartfelt best wishes written on personalized cards. We are especially excited for Adam as he embarks on his upcoming internship at TMX, and we wish Yasmine tremendous success as she begins her new academic school year tomorrow. This isn't goodbye but more of a "see you later," as we hope to welcome both Adam and Yasmine back in the future. The day was filled with gratitude, memories, and well wishes for their bright futures ahead. We captured this special moment with a group picture in front of the cake, a token of appreciation for all theyâ€™ve brought to our team. Until we meet again, we wish Adam and Yasmine all the best in their future endeavors!
