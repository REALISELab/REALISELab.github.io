Great news! Concordia has decided to fund the second edition of REANIMATE, our summer school on Retro Gaming History, Critic, and Development. This funds are part of the Aid to Research Related Events, Exhibition, Publication and Dissemination Activities (ARRE) Program.

The first edition of [Reanimate'24](https://reanimate.school/) was organized by [Prof. Yann Gael and team](https://reanimate.school/organisers/), and had a rich program, with 11 speakers from academia and industry, who shared their knowledge to participants of the event. The event included 5 full days of activities with talks, game jams, workshops, and it was a success. I am thrilled to join the organization for the second event, and glad that Concordia will be able to host the summer school again in 2025.
