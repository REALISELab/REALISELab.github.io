How does smaller and open-source Large Language Models compare to ChatGPT in tasks like code refinement?
Our study dives into code reviews, a cornerstone of modern software development. While code reviews are indispensable for ensuring quality and transferring knowledge, they can also become bottlenecks in large-scale projects.
- Inspired by a recent papaer by [Guo et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08221), we explore how open-source models like CodeLlama and Llama 2 (7B parameters) measure up against proprietary solutions like ChatGPT for automating code refinement tasks. 
- Our findings show that with proper tuning, these open-source models can offer an interesting balance between performance, cost-efficiency, and privacy.
- This research not only opens doors for privacy-conscious and cost-effective solutions but also sheds light on where current AI models shineâ€”and where they still need a human touch.
