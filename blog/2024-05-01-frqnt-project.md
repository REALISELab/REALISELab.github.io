I am thrilled to announce that FRQNT has funded our research program “Harnessing Software Ecosystems to Support Library Maintainers”, as part of the [Support for New Academics program](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/research-support-for-new-academics-frqnt/).

This is a 2-year program, designed to support maintainers in improving the reliability and quality of open-
source software libraries by leveraging their dependent ecosystem. This project’s goal is to provide
solutions that help maintainers 
1. understand how dependents use their library to plan their library evolution and 
2. harness the tests of the dependent ecosystem to improve the quality of their library project.
