Huge congratulations to Rachna Raj for receiving the Google 2025 North America PhD Fellowship in Software Engineering and Programming Languages!

Rachna's PhD project focuses on developing techniques to support open-source software maintainers. It is amazing to see Google's and Google Research recognition and support for such a significant problem. 

Interested in her work? Please take a look at our latest #ICSE paper, "Towards Supporting Open Source Library Maintainers with Community-Based Analytics." She will present this work in Rio de Janeiro in April 2026.
