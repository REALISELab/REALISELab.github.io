Are you interested in training Chatbots for Software Engineering tasks? Our paper "A Transformer-based Approach for Augmenting Software Engineering Chatbots Datasets" has been accepted at 18th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2024). 
- In this paper, we propose an approach to augment Chatbot training datasets tailored for Sofdrware Engineering tasks. 

We are currently finalizing the camera-ready version of the paper, and we will share the preprint soon. Stay tuned for more updates!
