Finding performance regressions usually require the execution of long and costly performance test suites. This is because performance tests often have to test the system end-to-end. Could we reduce the testing costs by testing locally (e.g., module, a service, method) and using a model to predict the impact of local changes no the system as a whole? 

Our new paper proposes exactly this! The paper entitled "Early Detection of Performance Regressions by Bridging Local Performance Data and Architectural Models" has been accepted at 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025). 

We are currently finalizing the camera-ready version of the paper, and we will share the preprint soon. Stay tuned for more updates!
