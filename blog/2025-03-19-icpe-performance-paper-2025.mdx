Our latest paper introduces a unique dataset of performance measurements and alerts from Mozilla, supporting research in performance engineering and anomaly detection.
Collected from Mozilla Firefox’s testing systems, this dataset contains 5,655 time series, 17,989 performance alerts, and Mozilla engineers-validated annotations spanning one year from May 2023 to May 2024. By making this resource publicly available [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14642238), we hope that we’re supporting researchers conducting research in performance characterization, regression prediction, bug analysis, and root cause investigation.
We will present this work in the International Conference of Performance Engineering occurring in York University in Toronto between May 5th and May 9th, 2025.
